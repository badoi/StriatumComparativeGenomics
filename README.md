## Multi-species integration of single cell striatal projection neurons
This repository includes the code for comparative integrative analyses of single cell datasets of the mammalian striatum. 

The main R-scripts to perform the integration and marker gene analyses are include in the `code/` directory.
- `step0_*.R`: performs dataset specific manipulations to subset data if not already down to striatal projection neurons based on original publication labels
- `step1_integrate_multispecies_striatum.ARC.R`: performs Seurat reciprocal PCA integration of the SCTransform normalized counts from snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data in a guided manner
- `step2_compute_species_specific_marker_genes.R`: calculates dataset conserved marker genes across the subset of snRNA-seq datasets for cell types and subtypes

The scripts to generate the main and supplemental figures are included in the `figures/` directory.
- `plot_multispecies_integration.R`: plots the UMAP and marker gene plots for the main and supplemental figures
- `plot_multispecies_proportions.R`: calculates the and plots the cell type proportions across striatal subregions

Due to size constraints, the single cell `.h5Seurat` files that contain the integrated cell type and spatial subtype labels are located at _http://daphne.compbio.cs.cmu.edu/files/bnphan/StriatumComparativeGenomics/_.
Seurat files of the integrated objects and separated by each dataset are located [here](http://daphne.compbio.cs.cmu.edu/files/bnphan/StriatumComparativeGenomics/data/tidy_data/rdas/)
